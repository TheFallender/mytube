# MyTube

This app will let you use the Youtube API to search videos and select videos from Youtube.

To install it you have to do the following:

1. Download the release.
2. Extract the compressed file wherever you want.
3. Open the terminal and go to the folder where you extracted the release.
4. Type `yarn`
5. Type `yarn start`

~~You can also visit https://thefallender.github.io/mytube to see it working.~~ Site is offline now, you can still build it on local.

You are able to find my API key in "youtube.js" but IT WON'T WORK ON LOCAL, you'll have to get your own API key at https://console.developers.google.com/apis
